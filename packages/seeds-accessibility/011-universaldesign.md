## Universal Design

### One Experience to Rule Them All

- A Universal Design approach means we consistently focus on:
	- User Experience
		- Clean, intuitive and logical design and semantic structure
			- Use semantic headings to segment and label pages
			- Consider the "outline" version of a page
		- Clear, concise and straightforward copy
			- Sprout Social app is currently accessible to speakers of English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. In order to best accommodate these audiences, keep copy short and to the point, as translations are more likely to greatly increase in size (character count) and lose clarity from a "wordy" English source.
			- **Acronyms** - must always be defined out upon first-use
		- Usage
			- **Equitable** - the design and fair and impartial
			- **Flexible** - the app allows for multiple input/output methods to accommodate user needs/preferences
			- **Perceptible** - Can the information be easily digested and understood? Either visually, through audio, or through other Assistive Technologies (ATs)?
			- **Tolerance For Error** - Does the app degrade gracefully?
			- **Forgiving** - Can a user feel confident that they can explore without fear of breaking something or reverting a change?
			- **Low Physical Effort** - Is it physically strenuous to use the app? Are there other paths of interaction if a user has a motor impairment?
