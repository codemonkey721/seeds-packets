## Usage

### Best Practices

Icons help guide the user to an action but do not perform better than text. If using an icon alone, be aware that icons are not always universally understood or translatable to other languages.

- Icons can serve as bulletpoints, structuring a webpage (ie. file type icons for PDFs, DOCs, etc.).
- Good icons can make the look of a webpage more pleasing. 

### Do’s and Don’ts

- **DON’T:** Modify or change partner network icons
- **DO:** Use universally understood icons when possible (ie. print, close, play/pause, reply, tweet, share on Facebook)
