## Examples

Icons should be designed at both 20px and 16px on a 24px artboard to accommodate both regular and small icons in applications. Icons should be created using basic shapes such as circles, rectangles (horizontal and vertical) and squares. Using these shapes within the defined grid keeps consistency across icons.

### Icon Sizes

Icons should be designed on both the 20px Large and a 16px Default grid (both on a 24px artboard) to accommodate both Product and System icons in applications.

### Product Icons

Product Icons are representations of the brandâ€™s products, services, and tools.

**Primary Full-Color**

The Sprout branded leaf has a full-color version and one color outlined version. No other version of this leaf should be used. There are 4 publicly marketed platforms of the app that use the 4-color branded greens. There is one internally used hashtag icon that is also acceptable to use the 4-color primary green treatment.

- Publishing (paper airplane)
- Engagement (heart)
- Reports (beaker)
- Collaboration (chat bubbles)
- #TeamSprout (hashtag) *internal only*

No other icons beyond this list will ever use the 4-color Sprout branded greens.

**Secondary Full-Color**

The Secondary icons are predominately used for marketing purposes and are usually paired with photographs or illustrations in various materials i.e. print, websites, emails etc. You can find them inside the app when a story needs to be told, i.e. upgrade dialogs, help guides (tech), dashboard.

**2-color**

The Tertiary icons can be any of the main feature icons in the library. They are always 2-color only using the green, teal, and blue Sprout branded palettes.

### System Icons

System Icons are representations of a command, file, device, directory, or common action.

Our 1-color system icons use thick lines when necessary and fill the shape of each illustrated icon with a solid color from our brand palette.
