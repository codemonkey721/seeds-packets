## Accessibility

We aspire to meet the WCAG 2.0 AA Standards.

**The most important aspect of Depth and Elevation in regards to Accessibility are affordances.**
* Elevation used on focus is not sufficient as the only indicator. 
	* Do not remove the `outline` CSS property
* Elevation does not replace the need for semantic markup.
